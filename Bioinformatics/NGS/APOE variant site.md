# APOE 정리

The APOE gene is polymorphic arising from different alleles - designated ε 2, 3 and 4 - at a single gene locus. The three major isoforms, APOE *ε2* (APOE2), APOE *ε3* (APOE3), and APOE *ε4* (APOE4), differ from one another by single nucleotide C/T transitions at two locations in exon 4 of APOE, resulting in a cysteine/arginine substitution at two positions affecting residues 130 and 176 in the synthesized protein containing the signal-peptide and residues 112 and 158 in the mature APOE protein. 



The most common alleles (wild type *ɛ3* or *ɛ2* and *ɛ4*) at the APOE locus code for three different [protein isoforms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/isoprotein) (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) that differ in [amino acid sequence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peptide-sequence) at positions 130 and 176. APOE2 contains [cysteine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cysteine) at positions 130 and 176, APOE3 has cysteine at 130 and arginine at 176, whereas APOE4 contains arginine at both sites.

Evidence exists to suggest that the variability of APOE has differential effects on the atheroprotective potential attributed to apoE (5, 6). The 2/3/4 polymorphism of APOE is caused by two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 334T/C and 472C/T, which are in close physical proximity and absolute linkage disequilibrium (5, 9). The 334T/C and 472C/T SNPs exclusively determine three haplotypes, known as the 2 (334T/472T), 3 (334C/472T), and 4 (334C/472C) alleles of APOE (5). This heterogeneity causes variation at amino acid positions 112 (cysteine or arginine) and 158 (arginine or cysteine) of apoE, resulting in three different isoforms of apoE
