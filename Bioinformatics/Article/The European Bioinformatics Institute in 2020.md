## Abstract

* EMBL-EBL focuses on data exchanges among resources, both within the institute and with a wider global infrastructure.

* key component of a global infrastructure of interconnected life sciences data resources

<br>

## Introduction: Archival Resources and Knowledgebases

* EMBL-EBI data rewources cover the entire range of molecular biology and include nucleotide sequence data, protein sequences and families, chemical biology, structural biology, systems, pathways, ontologies and the scientific literature.
* EMBL-EBI strongly supports the concept of FAIR data (findable, accessible, interoperable, and resuable)

<Br>

## EMBL-EBI Data Resources: Open Data And The Global Data Infrastructure

* EMBL-EBI data resuorces are open, their role is to collate, integrate, curate and make freely available to the public the world's scienrific data.
